          At McDonald, we take great care to serve quality, great-tasting menu
          items to our customers each and every time they visit our restaurants.
          We understand that each of our customers has individual needs and
          considerations when choosing a place to eat or drink outside their
          home, especially those customers with food allergies. As part of our
          commitment to you, we provide the most current ingredient information
          available from our food suppliers for the eight most common allergens
          as identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (eggs, dairy,
          wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish), so that our
          guests with food allergies can make informed food selections. However,
          we also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal
          kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation
          areas, equipment and utensils, and the possibility exists for your
          food items to come in contact with other food products, including
          allergens. We encourage our customers with food allergies or special
          dietary needs to visit www.mcdonalds.com for ingredient information,
          and to consult their doctor for questions regarding their diet. If you
          have questions about our food, please reach out to us directly using
          our contact us forms.

          The nutrition information on this website is derived from testing
          conducted in accredited laboratories, published resources, or from
          information provided from McDonalds suppliers. The nutrition
          information is based on standard product formulations and serving
          sizes. Calories for fountain beverages are based on standard fill
          levels plus ice. If you use the self-service fountain inside the
          restaurant for your drink order, see the sign posted at the beverage
          fountain for beverage calories without ice. All nutrition information
          is based on average values for ingredients and is rounded in
          accordance with current U.S. FDA NLEA regulations. Variation in
          serving sizes, preparation techniques, product testing and sources of
          supply, as well as regional and seasonal differences may affect the
          nutrition values for each product. In addition, product formulations
          change periodically. You should expect some variation in the nutrient
          content of the products purchased in our restaurants. Beverage sizes
          may vary in your market. McDonaldâ€™s USA does not certify or claim any
          of its US menu items as Halal, Kosher or meeting any other religious
          requirements. We do not promote any of our US menu items as
          vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. This information is correct as of
          January 2022, unless stated otherwise.
